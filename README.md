An [mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat) plugin for admonitions.

## Development

This package utilizes [flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io) as the build engine, and [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) for test automation.

To install these development dependencies:

```bash
pip install tox
```

To run the tests:

```bash
tox
```

and with test coverage:

```bash
tox -e py37-cov
```

The easiest way to write tests, is to edit `tests/fixtures.md`

To run the code formatting and style checks:

```bash
tox -e py37-pre-commit
```

or directly

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit run --all
```

To run the pre-commit hook test:

```bash
tox -e py37-hook
```

## Publish to PyPi

Either use flit directly:

```bash
pip install flit
flit publish
```

or trigger the GitHub Action job, by creating a release with a tag equal to the version, e.g. `v0.0.1`.

Note, this requires generating an API key on PyPi and adding it to the repository `Settings/Secrets`, under the name `PYPI_KEY`.
